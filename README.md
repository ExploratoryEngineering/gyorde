# gyorde -- IMSI checker

I'm probably going to regret this name since it warrants an explanation and is
slightly imprecise.

This is a gRPC interface for the Gy processing service (3GPP charging protocol)
and Horde. There's nothing stopping you from using this from another process.

It's just a protobuf file and a sample server right now. If you don't know what
"Horde", "Gy" or "gRPC" is you can safely ignore this repo.

You'll need the protobuf compiler to build this project.
